## What is ExecutorService?

ExecutorService is a high-level replacement for working with threads directly. It **automatically provides a pool of threads and an API for assigning tasks to it**.

### Key Benefits:

- Improved performance when executing large numbers of asynchronous tasks
- Reduced per-task invocation overhead
- Provides means of bounding and managing resources consumed when executing tasks


## Key Differences from Thread and Runnable

| Feature | Thread/Runnable | ExecutorService |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Thread Management | Manual creation/destruction | Automatic thread pool management |
| Task Scheduling | Manual | Automatic task queue management |
| Resource Control | No built-in limits | Controls number of concurrent threads |
| Error Handling | Affects entire system | Isolates task failures |

## Thread Pool Types with Executors

### 1. newFixedThreadPool()

**Creates a pool with a fixed number of threads**

```java
ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(20);
```

**Characteristics:**

- ‚úÖ Fixed number of threads (specified in constructor)
- ‚úÖ Uses LinkedBlockingQueue (unbounded)
- ‚úÖ Additional tasks wait in queue when all threads are busy
- üéØ **Best for:** Known workload with predictable resource requirements


### 2. newCachedThreadPool()

**Creates a pool that can create new threads as needed**

```java
ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
```

**Characteristics:**

- ‚úÖ Creates threads on-demand
- ‚úÖ Reuses idle threads for 60 seconds
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No limit on pool size (can grow indefinitely)
- üéØ **Best for:** Short-lived asynchronous tasks with unpredictable workload


### 3. newSingleThreadExecutor()

**Creates a single worker thread that executes tasks sequentially**

```java
ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
```

**Characteristics:**

- ‚úÖ Only one thread in the pool
- ‚úÖ Tasks executed sequentially (one after another)
- ‚úÖ Guarantees task order execution
- üéØ **Best for:** Tasks that must be executed in strict order


## Callable, Future, and CompletionService

### Callable Interface

**Can return computed results and throw checked exceptions** (unlike Runnable)

```java
static class FactorialService implements Callable<Long> {
    private int number;
    
    public FactorialService(int number) {
        this.number = number;
    }
    
    @Override
    public Long call() throws Exception {
        return factorial();
    }
}
```


### Future Interface

**Provides methods to monitor task progress and retrieve results**

```java
Future<Long> result10 = executor.submit(new FactorialService(10));
Long factorial10 = result10.get(); // Blocks until result is available
```

**Key Future Methods:**

- `get()` - Retrieves result (blocks if not ready)
- `get(timeout, unit)` - Retrieves result with timeout
- `isDone()` - Checks if task is completed
- `cancel()` - Attempts to cancel task execution


### CompletionService

**Separates production and consumption of completed tasks**

```java
CompletionService<Integer> cs = new ExecutorCompletionService<>(executor);

// Submit tasks
for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    cs.submit(new Task(i));
}

// Process results as they complete
for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    Future<Integer> result = cs.take(); // Blocks until a result is available
    System.out.println(result.get());
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Process results in completion order (not submission order)
- Simplifies handling of multiple concurrent tasks


## ScheduledExecutorService for Scheduled Tasks

**Sub-interface of ExecutorService created especially for task scheduling**

### Key Methods:

1. **schedule()** - Execute once after a delay
2. **scheduleAtFixedRate()** - Execute repeatedly at fixed intervals
3. **scheduleWithFixedDelay()** - Execute repeatedly with fixed delay between executions
```java
ScheduledExecutorService executor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1);

// Execute once after 2 seconds
executor.schedule(new Task(), 2, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

// Execute every 5 seconds starting after 3 seconds
executor.scheduleAtFixedRate(new Task(), 3, 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```


## How ExecutorService Implements Locking

### 1. Internal Queue Locking

- Uses **BlockingQueue implementations** (ArrayBlockingQueue, LinkedBlockingQueue)
- Handle thread-safe task queuing using internal locks


### 2. Thread Pool Synchronization

ThreadPoolExecutor maintains thread pool state using internal synchronization for:

- Thread creation and destruction
- Task assignment to worker threads
- Pool size management


### 3. Integration with External Locks

```java
public class LockManager {
    Map<String, Lock> lockById = new HashMap<>(1000);
    
    public synchronized Lock getLock(String id) {
        Lock lock = lockById.get(id);
        if (lock == null) {
            lock = new ReentrantLock(true); // Fair lock
            lockById.put(id, lock);
        }
        return lock;
    }
}

// Usage in ExecutorService task
public void performAction(RunnableAction action) {
    Lock lock = lockManager.getLock(action.getId());
    lock.lock();
    try {
        action.execute();
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }
}
```


### 4. Fair vs Non-Fair Scheduling

```java
ExecutorService executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
    threads, threads,
    0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,
    new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1000, true) // Fair queue
);
```


## Best Practices and Advanced Usage

### 1. Proper Shutdown ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT

```java
executor.shutdown(); // Allows existing tasks to complete
// OR
executor.shutdownNow(); // Attempts to stop all tasks immediately
```


### 2. Exception Handling

- **ScheduledExecutorService tasks are isolated**
- If one task fails, the scheduler as a whole does not stop
- Always handle exceptions properly in your tasks


### 3. Thread Pool Sizing Guidelines

| Workload Type | Recommended Size |
| :-- | :-- |
| CPU-intensive tasks | Number of cores |
| I/O-intensive tasks | Higher than number of cores |
| Mixed workload | Monitor and tune based on performance |

### 4. Monitoring and Management

```java
// Monitor pool state
executor.getActiveCount();        // Number of actively executing tasks
executor.getCompletedTaskCount(); // Number of completed tasks
executor.getPoolSize();           // Current number of threads in pool
```


## Summary

ExecutorService provides a significantly more powerful and manageable approach to thread management compared to raw Thread and Runnable objects, offering:

- ‚úÖ Better resource utilization
- ‚úÖ Improved error handling
- ‚úÖ Enhanced scalability for concurrent applications
- ‚úÖ Automatic thread lifecycle management
- ‚úÖ Built-in task scheduling capabilities
