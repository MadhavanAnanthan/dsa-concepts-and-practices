**About Scheduling Algorithm**
Operating systems utilize scheduling algorithms to allocate CPU time based on priority and deadlines. These algorithms, incorporating methods like Round Robin, aim to prevent starvation, manage context switching, and optimize resource utilization. Ultimately, the goal is to keep the CPU consistently busy while ensuring fairness and responsiveness.

**First-Come, First-Served (FCFS):**
**Importance:** Simple and easy to implement.<br>
**Drawbacks:** Can lead to the "convoy effect," where a long process blocks shorter ones. Not ideal for interactive systems.<br>
**Shortest Job Next (SJN) or Shortest Remaining Time (SRT):**
**Importance:** Minimizes average waiting time and turnaround time.<br>
**Drawbacks:** Requires knowing the execution time of processes in advance (which is often impossible). Can lead to starvation of long processes.<br>
**Priority Scheduling:**
**Importance:** Allows important processes to be given higher priority.<br>
**Drawbacks:** Can lead to starvation of low-priority processes.<br>
**Round Robin (RR):**
**Importance:** Provides fair allocation of CPU time to all processes. Good for interactive systems.<br>
**Drawbacks:** Can lead to high context-switching overhead if the time quantum (time slice) is too small.<br>
**Multilevel Queue Scheduling:**
**Importance:** Allows different scheduling algorithms to be used for different types of processes.<br>
**Drawbacks:** More complex to implement.<br>
**Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling:**<br>
**Importance:** Dynamically adjusts process priorities based on their behavior. Reduces starvation and improves overall performance.<br>
**Drawbacks:** More complex to implement.
