<h2>Input/Output (I/O) Systems: I/O devices, controllers, interrupts, DMA</h2>

**I/O Devices:** Physical components enabling computer interaction with the external world (e.g., keyboard, monitor, hard drive).<br>
**Controllers:** Hardware components managing data flow between CPU and I/O devices, handling device-specific operations (e.g., disk controller, USB controller).<br>
**Interrupts:** Signals from I/O devices/controllers to the CPU indicating an event needing attention, allowing asynchronous I/O handling (e.g., keyboard interrupt, disk interrupt).<br>
**DMA (Direct Memory Access):** Technique enabling I/O devices to transfer data directly to/from memory without CPU involvement during transfer, reducing CPU overhead for high-speed I/O.
