### Assembly Language

* Assembly language is a low level language, it will have direct control over hardware than high-level languages(less abstraction).
* It uses (mnemonics) kind of instructions contains instructions types such ADD, MOV, later the instructions will be processed using processor.
* It gives direct access to hardware, so developers have full hardware control and will promotes to write fully optimised code based on processor. (Assembly language are processor's architecture (ISA) specific, this means assembly code written for one type of processor will not work for other processors)
* Assembler is similar to compiler to convert the assembly language code into machine code.
* Anyone can learn assembly language, theoratically assembly language are faster than high level language such as java and pyhton only in some situations. but nowadays high level language compilers are highly efficient.
* Improves Performance optimisation and directly access the memory address (which is not in java - pointers)

```assembly
MOV AX, 5; Move the value 5 into register AX
ADD AX, 10; Add the value 10 into value in AX
```
In summary, assembly langauge is a powerful tool for programmers who need low level control over computer hardware.
