<h2>Programming Paradigms</h2>

<p>It's helpful to think of programming paradigms as different philosophies or styles of writing code. Here's a breakdown of some of the most common ones:</p>

<h3>Major Paradigms:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Imperative Programming:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>This paradigm focuses on describing <em>how</em> a program should execute. It involves explicit instructions that change the program's state.</li>
      <li>Key concepts: Sequential execution, variables, and assignments.</li>
      <li>Examples: C, C++, Java (primarily), Python (partially).</li>
      <li>Sub-paradigms:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Procedural Programming:</strong> Organizes code into procedures (functions or subroutines). Examples: C, Fortran.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Declarative Programming:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>This paradigm focuses on describing <em>what</em> a program should accomplish, rather than how.</li>
      <li>Key concepts: Expressing logic without explicitly specifying control flow.</li>
      <li>Examples: SQL, HTML, CSS, Prolog.</li>
      <li>Sub-paradigms:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Functional Programming:</strong> Treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state. Examples: Haskell, Lisp, Scala.</li>
          <li><strong>Logic Programming:</strong> Uses logical statements to express facts and rules. Examples: Prolog.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>This paradigm organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. Objects encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods).</li>
      <li>Key concepts: Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism.</li>
      <li>Examples: Java, C++, Python, C#.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Event-Driven Programming:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>This paradigm focuses on responding to events, such as user interactions or system messages.</li>
      <li>Key concepts: Event loops, event handlers.</li>
      <li>Examples: JavaScript (in web browsers), GUI applications.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional Paradigms:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Data-Driven Programming:</strong> The program's behavior is determined by data, rather than hard-coded logic.</li>
  <li><strong>Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP):</strong> Focuses on separating cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, security) from the main program logic.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Differences:</h3>

<p><strong>Imperative vs. Declarative:</strong> The fundamental difference lies in <em>how</em> vs. <em>what</em>. Imperative programming provides step-by-step instructions, while declarative programming describes the desired outcome.</p>

<p>It's important to note that many modern programming languages support multiple paradigms, allowing developers to choose the most appropriate style for a given task.</p>
