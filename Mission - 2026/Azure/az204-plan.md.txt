# AZ-204 (Azure Developer Associate) – A to Z Study Plan
**Target Exam:** March 2026  
**Study End Date:** Feb 28, 2026  
**Daily Commitment:** 1 hour/day  
**Goal:** Learn Azure developer concepts deeply (not just pass the exam)

## Study Principles

- Follow **Microsoft Learn** as the primary source
- Use **Azure Docs selectively** (only exam-relevant sections)
- Use **AI for clarification**, not as a syllabus
- Avoid admin-heavy or non-AZ-204 topics
- Certification should be a **by-product of real understanding**
